# CS-RANKINGS

A better version of NIRF.

Documentation for scrapping:

1. Run scraper_script.py to download all the yearwise and Institute-wise pdf files from the NIRF webpage.
2. Run convert_pdf_tables.py to convert pdfs into pandas dataframes and dump them to csv files. (Better formatting / cleaning needed.)
